title: Package Consumption

Available in [v0.17.0-alpha.1+](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/carvel-kapp-controller/tree/dev-packaging/alpha-releases)

Before jumping in, we recommend reading through the docs about the new [packaging
apis](packaging.md) to familiarize yourself with the YAML configuration used in these
workflows.

This workflow walks through the example contained in
the [`packaging-demo`](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/carvel-kapp-controller/tree/dev-packaging/examples/packaging-demo).

## Prerequisites

* You will need to [install the alpha release](install-alpha.md) on a Kubernetes cluster to go through the examples.
* The instructions below assume [`kapp`](/kapp) and `kubectl` are installed.

## Adding package repository

kapp-controller needs to know which packages are available to install. One way to let it know about available packages is by registering a package repository. To do this, we need a PackageRepository CR:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: install.package.carvel.dev/v1alpha1
kind: PackageRepository
metadata:
  name: simple-package-repository
spec:
  fetch:
    imgpkgBundle:
      image: k8slt/corp-com-pkg-repo:1.0.0
```

If the registry containing the repository is private, a secret ref will
need to be added to the fetch stage. For example,

```yaml
---
apiVersion: install.package.carvel.dev/v1alpha1
kind: PackageRepository
metadata:
  name: simple-package-repository
spec:
  fetch:
    image:
      url: k8slt/corp-com-pkg-repo:1.0.0
      secretRef:
        name: my-registry-creds
```
This secret will need to be located in the kapp-controller namespace and be of
the format described in the [fetch docs](config.md#image-authentication).

**Note:** This is a temporary authentication model and will change in the
future.

This PackageRepository CR will allow kapp-controller to install any of the
packages found within the `k8slt/kctrl-pkg-repo:v1.0.0` imgpkg bundle, which is
stored in an OCI registry. Save this PackageRepository to a file named repo.yml
and then apply it to the cluster using kapp:



```bash
$ kapp deploy -a repo -f repo.yml
```

Once the deploy has finished, we are able to list the packages and see which ones are now available:

```bash
$ kubectl get packages
NAME                             PUBLIC-NAME           VERSION      AGE
simple-app.corp.com.1.0.0        simple-app.corp.com   1.0.0        20s
simple-app.corp.com.2.0.0        simple-app.corp.com   2.0.0        20s
simple-app.corp.com.3.0.0-rc.1   simple-app.corp.com   3.0.0-rc.1   20s
```

If we want, we can inspect these packages further to get more info about what they're installing:

```bash
$ kubectl get package simple-app.corp.com.1.0.0 -o yaml
```

This will show us the package yaml, which will look something like this:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: package.carvel.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Package
metadata:
  name: simple-app.corp.com.1.0.0
spec:
  publicName: simple-app.corp.com
  version: 1.0.0
  displayName: "simple-app v1.0.0"
  description: "Package for simple-app version 1.0.0"
  template:
    spec:
      fetch:
      - imgpkgBundle:
          image: k8slt/kctrl-example-pkg:v1.0.0
      template:
      - ytt:
          paths:
          - "config.yml"
          - "values.yml"
      - kbld:
          paths:
          - "-"
          - ".imgpkg/images.yml"
      deploy:
      - kapp: {}
```

This simple package will fetch the templates stored in the
`k8slt/kctrl-example-pkg:v1.0.0` bundle, template them using ytt and kbld, and finally
deploy them using kapp. Once deployed, there will be a basic greeter app
running in the cluster. Since this is what we want, we can now move on to installation.

## Installing a package

Once we have the packages available for installation (as seen via `kubectl get package`) we need to let kapp-controller know what we want to install. To do this, we will need to create an InstalledPackage CR (and a secret to hold the values used by our package):

```yaml
---
apiVersion: install.package.carvel.dev/v1alpha1
kind: InstalledPackage
metadata:
  name: pkg-demo
  namespace: default
spec:
  serviceAccountName: default-ns-sa
  packageRef:
    publicName: simple-app.corp.com
    version: 1.0.0
  values:
  - secretRef:
      name: pkg-demo-values
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: pkg-demo-values
stringData:
  values.yml: |
    #@data/values
    ---
    hello_msg: "hi"
```

This CR references the package we decided to install in the previous section
using the Package CR's `publicName` and `version`. The InstalledPackage also
references the service account which will be used to install the package, as well
as values to include in the templating step in order to customize our installation.

To install above package, we will also need to create `default-ns-sa` service account (refer to [Security model](security-model.md) for explanation of how service accounts are used) that give kapp-controller privileges to create resources in the default namespace:

```bash
$ kapp deploy -a default-ns-rbac -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmware-tanzu/carvel-kapp-controller/develop/examples/rbac/default-ns.yml
```

Save the InstalledPackage above to a file named installedpkg.yml and then apply the
InstalledPackage using kapp:

```bash
$ kapp deploy -a pkg-demo -f installedpkg.yml
```

After the deploy has finished, kapp-controller will have installed the package in the
cluster. We can verify this by checking the pods to see that we have a workload pod
running. The output should show a single running pod which is part of simple-app:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
simple-app-58f865df65-kmhld   1/1     Running   0          2m
```

If we now use kubectl's port forwarding functionality, we can also see the our
customized hello message as been used in the workload:

```bash
$ kubectl port-forward service/simple-app  3000:80
```

Then, from another window:

```bash
$ curl localhost:3000
<h1>Hello hi!</h1>%
```

And we see that our hello_msg value is used.

## Uninstalling a package

To uninstall a package, simply delete the InstalledPackage CR:

```bash
$ kapp delete -a pkg-demo
```
