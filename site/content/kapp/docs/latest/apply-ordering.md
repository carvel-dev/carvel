title: Apply Ordering
---

## Overview

kapp includes builtin rules to make sure certain changes are applied in particular order:

- Creates/updates
  - CRDs are created/updated before custom resources
  - Namespaces are created/updated before namespaced resources
  - Pod related resources (ServiceAccount, ConfigMap, Secret, etc.) are created/updated before other resources (v0.25.0+)
  - RBAC related resources (Role, RoleBinding, etc.) are created/updated before other resources (v0.25.0+)
- Deletions (below is order as of v0.29.0+)
  - Custom resources are deleted first
  - CRDs are deleted next
  - Rest of resoures are deleted

As of v0.25.0+, builtin rules are specified via [changeGroupBindings and changeRuleBindings](config.md#changegroupbindings) configurations. Custom rules can be added via same mechanism.

Additionally kapp allows to customize order of changes via following resource annotations:

- `kapp.k14s.io/change-group` annotation to group one or more resource changes into arbitrarily named group. Example: `apps.big.co/db-migrations`. You can specify multiple change groups by suffixing each annotation with a `.x` where `x` is unique identifier (e.g. `kapp.k14s.io/change-group.istio-sidecar-order`).
- `kapp.k14s.io/change-rule` annotation to control when resource change should be applied (created, updated, or deleted) relative to other changes. You can specify multiple change rules by suffixing each annotation with a `.x` where `x` is unique identifier (e.g. `kapp.k14s.io/change-rule.istio-sidecar-order`).

`kapp.k14s.io/change-rule` annotation value format is as follows: `(upsert|delete) (after|before) (upserting|deleting) <name>`. For example:

- `kapp.k14s.io/change-rule: "upsert after upserting apps.big.co/db-migrations"`
- `kapp.k14s.io/change-rule: "delete before upserting apps.big.co/service"`

## Example

Following example shows how to run `job/migrations`, start and wait for `deployment/app`, and finally `job/app-health-check`.

```yaml
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-config
  annotations: {}
#...
---
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: migrations
  annotations:
    kapp.k14s.io/change-group: "apps.big.co/db-migrations"
#...
---
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: app
  annotations:
    kapp.k14s.io/change-group: "apps.big.co/deployment"
#...
---
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: app
  annotations:
    kapp.k14s.io/change-group: "apps.big.co/deployment"
#...
---
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app
  annotations:
    kapp.k14s.io/change-group: "apps.big.co/deployment"
    kapp.k14s.io/change-rule: "upsert after upserting apps.big.co/db-migrations"
#...
---
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: app-health-check
  annotations:
    kapp.k14s.io/change-rule: "upsert after upserting apps.big.co/deployment"
#...
```
