# Security Procedures

The Carvel community holds security in the highest regard.

The community adopted this security disclosure policy to ensure vulnerabilities are responsibly handled.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have identified a vulnerability, please work with the Carvel maintainers to fix it and disclose the issue responsibly.

All security issues, confirmed or suspected, should be reported privately.

Please avoid using github issues, and instead **report the vulnerability to cncf-carvel-maintainers@lists.cncf.io.**

A vulnerability report should be filed if any of the following applies:

* You have discovered and confirmed a vulnerability in Carvel.
* You believe Carvel might be vulnerable to some published [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/).
* You have found a potential security flaw in Carvel but you're not yet sure whether there's a viable attack vector.
* You have confirmed or suspect any of Carvel's dependencies has a vulnerability.

### Vulnerability report template

Provide a descriptive subject line and in the body of the email include the following information:

*   Basic identity information, such as your name and your affiliation or company.
*   Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability  (POC scripts, screenshots, and logs are all helpful to us).
*   Description of the effects of the vulnerability on Carvel and the related hardware and software configurations, so that the Carvel Team can reproduce it.
*   How the vulnerability affects Carvel usage and an estimation of the attack surface, if there is one.
*   List other projects or dependencies that were used in conjunction with Carvel to produce the vulnerability.

## Responding to a vulnerability

A coordinator is assigned to each reported security issue. The coordinator is a member from the Carvel maintainers team, and will drive the fix and disclosure process.

At the moment reports are received via email at cncf-carvel-maintainers@lists.cncf.io.

The first steps performed by the coordinator are to confirm the validity of the report and send an embargo reminder to all parties involved.

Carvel maintainers and issue reporters will review the issue for confirmation of impact and determination of affected components.

A public disclosure date is negotiated by the Carvel Maintainers, the bug submitter, and the distributors list. 
We prefer to fully disclose the bug as soon as possible once a user mitigation or patch is available. 
It is reasonable to delay disclosure when the bug or the fix is not yet fully understood, the solution is not well-tested, or for distributor coordination. 
The timeframe for disclosure is from immediate (especially if itâ€™s already publicly known) to a few weeks. For a critical vulnerability with a straightforward mitigation, we expect the report date for the public disclosure date to be on the order of 14 business days. 
The Carvel Maintainers hold the final say when setting a public disclosure date.

With reference to the scale reported below, reported vulnerabilities will be disclosed and treated as regular issues if their issue risk is low (level 4 or higher in the scale).

For these lower-risk issues the fix process will proceed with the usual github workflow.

### Reference taxonomy for issue risk

1. Vulnerability must be fixed in main and any other supported branch.
2. Vulnerability must be fixed in main only for next release.
3. Vulnerability in experimental features or troubleshooting code.
4. Vulnerability without practical attack vector (e.g.: needs GUID guessing).
5. Not a vulnerability per se, but an opportunity to strengthen security (in code, architecture, protocols, and/or processes).
6. Not a vulnerability or a strengthening opportunity.
7. Vulnerability only exist in some PR or non-release branch.

## Developing a patch for a vulnerability

This part of the process applies only to confirmed vulnerabilities.

The reporter and Carvel maintainers, plus anyone they deem necessary to develop and validate a fix will be included the discussion.

**Please refrain from creating a PR for the fix!**

A fix is proposed as a patch to the current main branch, formatted with:

```bash
git format-patch --stdout HEAD~1 > path/to/local/file.patch
```

and then sent to cncf-carvel-maintainers@lists.cncf.io.

**Please don't push the patch to the Carvel fork on your github account!**

Patch review will be performed via email. Reviewers will suggest modifications and/or improvements, and then pre-approve it for merging.

Pre-approval will ensure patches can be fast-tracked through public code review later at disclosure time.

## Disclosing the vulnerability

In preparation for this, at least a maintainer must be available to help pushing the fix at disclosure time.

At the disclosure time, one of the maintainers (or the reporter) will open an issue on github and create a PR with the patch for the main branch and any other applicable branch. Available maintainers will fast-track approvals and merge the patch.

Regardless of the owner of the issue and the corresponding PR, the original reporter and the submitter of the fix will be properly credited.

As for the git history, the commit message and author of the pre-approved patch will be preserved in the final patch submitted into the Carvel repository.

### Notes

At the moment the Carvel project does not have a process to assign a CVE to a confirmed vulnerability.
