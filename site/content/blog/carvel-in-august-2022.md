### kapp

kapp had two releases in August:

* [v0.52.0](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/carvel-kapp/releases/tag/v0.52.0)
    * Added `--default-label-scoping-rules` flag to enable or disable the default label scoping rules added during deploy
    * Bump k8s.io/client-go from v0.22.10 to v0.24.3
    * Bug fix: `--app-metadata-file-output` writes to disk even when deploy fails
* [v0.51.0](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/carvel-kapp/releases/tag/v0.51.0)
    * Added `--app-metadata-file-output` flag which can be used to save recorded app metadata to a file.
    * Bump modern-go/reflect2 to v1.0.2 to fix incompatibility with Go v1.18
        * This problem became apparent with some random failures while trying to connect to GKE clusters.
        * Example error fixed `unexpected fault address 0xb01dfacedebac1e fatal error: fault`

### kapp-controller

* [v0.40.0](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/carvel-kapp-controller/releases/tag/v0.40.0)
    * kctrl
        * Introducing the package authoring commands
        * dev deploy
    * Packages can constrain Kubernetes and kapp-controller versions
    * Package authors can now specify that their package can be installed on a certain versions of both kapp-controller and kubernetes.
    * Surface namespace and GK resources in AppCR status
    * Upgrade GoLang from 1.18 to 1.19
    * Bumped dependencies
* [v0.39.0](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/carvel-kapp-controller/releases/tag/v0.39.0)
    * Add arm64 builds
    * Add downward api
    * Rename KC owned apps from x-ctrl to x.app or x.pkgr

    * kctrl
        * Add tailing behaviour to package repo and add a package repo kick command
        * Disallow use of shared namespaces for package installs
        * Enhance tty experience


### imgpkg

* [v0.31.0](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/carvel-imgpkg/releases/tag/v0.31.0)
    * Resume the download of an image/bundle to tar
    * By providing the flag `--resume` to the `copy` command, imgpkg is now able to only download the missing blobs that cannot find in the file on disk. The flag doesn't error out if the tar file does not exist
    * Check if an image or bundle is cacheable or not. Note: This feature is only available on the new API call. Let us know if you see any benefit in implementing option 1 from that story.
    * API Improvements:
        * When calling the function to push images to the registry, via API, the user can provide a progress bar logger. This will allow for the progress to be displayed in the console.
        * Create API for Pull
        * Extracted the Pull logic to the new package that will contain imgpkg's public API, check [the package](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/carvel-imgpkg/tree/develop/pkg/imgpkg/v1). With this change, the Pull command can be changed to provide machine-readable output.

### ytt

August was spent collecting and acting upon feedback for schema validations. These features are planned to GA in mid-September. For a preview, see the below links.

* [Blog: Preview of ytt Validations](https://carvel.dev/blog/ytt-validations-preview/) on how to get setup with this feature.
