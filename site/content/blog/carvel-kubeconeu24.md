[KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/) is less than a week away and we can't wait to see you all! We will have a lightning talk, CFP-accepted sessions, and a kiosk in the [Project Pavilion](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/program/project-engagement/#project-pavilion) within the [Solutions Showcase](https://kccnceu2024.sched.com/overview/type/Solutions+Showcase?iframe=no). Below you can find more details on the opportunities you have to attend talks covering Carvel to learn more about the project and engage with us and other users of the Carvel tools. It's a great way to ask questions, meet the team in person, provide feedback, and connect with others in the community. We look forward to seeing you there!

### Main Conference – Kiosk in the Project Pavilion
The Project Pavilion is located within the Solutions Showcase and has a collection of kiosks staffed by maintainers, users, contributors, and community members of various CNCF projects. These provide a great opportunity for you to meet those who work on the projects, learn more about the projects, and share any feedback you may have, all in-person!

New this year, CNCF Sandbox projects can only have _one time block_ during the whole conference. **Carvel will have two maintainers to engage with you on Thursday, March 21, from 10:30–13:30 only**. So, don't miss your chance at meeting us in-person and having your burning questions answered in real-time!
