We're thrilled to share [Carvel on the keynote stage](https://sched.co/ocSC) with the global cloud native audience. Whether you're attending virtually or in-person, you'll hear from Shatarupa Nandi covering the tool suite with a demo included on October 15, 2021, at 9:40am PDT.


## Keynote Abstract

Today we can move beyond traditional ‘imperative’ package management approaches and instead use Kubernetes to ensure that packaged applications are automatically updated in the way that we need. Want to use the latest version of one package, but pick up only patch releases for another, all the time, automatically? Want to take advantage of GitOps to govern application updates? You can, with lightweight, easy-to-use Kubernetes tooling.  And that’s just the beginning. Join us to see how the Carvel project team is re-imagining package management for Kubernetes to bring you a modern, declarative way to automate end-to-end lifecycle management of packaged applications and their dependencies.


## New to Carvel?

Carvel is a suite of small, focused tools all built with a few guiding principles in mind:

* Declarative APIs so users can focus on their desired state and let the system get them there
* Composable, modular building blocks to give users full flexibility in how they work, while still preserving extensibility in their workflow

We have tools to meet your various needs. Need help with templating or overlaying your Kubernetes configurations? Try ytt. Need an easy way to manage the lifecycle of Kubernetes resources? Try kapp. Need to get software installed and keep it updated on a Kubernetes cluster in a secure and automated way or need to package and distribute your software to your users? Try kapp-controller and its package management APIs, which were launched last month. If you are interested in learning more about Carvel’s package management before the keynote, check out this [blog post](https://carvel.dev/blog/introduction-to-carvel-package-manager-for-kubernetes/).
