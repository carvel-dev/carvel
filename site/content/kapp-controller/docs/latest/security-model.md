## App CR privileges

kapp-controller container runs with a service account (named
`kapp-controller-sa` inside `kapp-controller` namespace) that has access to all
service accounts and secrets in the cluster. This service account *is not* used
for deployment of app resources.

Each App CR *must* specify either a

- service account (via `spec.serviceAccountName`)
- or, Secret with kubeconfig contents for some cluster (via `spec.cluster.kubeconfigSecretRef.name`)

forcing App CR owner to explicitly provide needed privileges for management of
app resources. This avoids a problem of privilege escalation commonly found in
other general resource controllers which rely on a shared service account (often
requiring cluster admin privileges) to deploy resources.

Since App CR only allows to reference service account or kubeconfig Secret
within the same namespace where App CR is located, kapp-controller is well
suited for multi-tenant use where different users of App CRD have varied level
of access (e.g. some may have cluster level privileges, and other may only have
access to one or more namespace).

Example:

- User A has been granted access to namespace `a` (and no other namespace or
  cluster level access). User A can create an App CR with a service account
  located in namespace `a` to deploy resources into namespace `a`. It _is not_
  possible for user A to create an App CR that would install cluster-wide
  resources or place resources into another namespace. (e.g. a user that just
  deploys web application to their namespace)

- User B has been granted access to namespace `b` and ability to manage
  specifically named CRD (single scoped cluster-wide privilege). User B can
  create an App CR with a service account located in namespace `b` that installs
  app into namespace `b` and also manages single CRD lifecycle. (e.g. a user
  that manages another controller for other users)

## Minimum ServiceAccount Permissions

For users managing App and PackageInstall CR privileges via a service account,
the verbs in the role below are needed for working with ConfigMaps. 

```yaml
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: app-ip-cr-role
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["configmaps"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "create", "update", "delete"]
```

These permissions are needed because of how `kapp` tracks information about apps
it manages, which is via storing information in a ConfigMap. So even if your App
or PackageInstall CR does not create ConfigMaps, the service account will
still need permissions for working with ConfigMaps.

The ConfigMap permissions above are needed in addition to any other
resource/verb combinations needed to deploy all resources created by the App and
PackageInstall CRs.
