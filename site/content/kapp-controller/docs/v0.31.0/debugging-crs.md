## Debugging kapp-controller CRs

### Reconcile failed
Your first alert to a failure
will come from the tool(s) (e.g. kapp or kubectl) you are using to deploy
kapp-controller CRs. `kapp` will more immediately tell you if a resource you are
creating or updating fails, but you will need to verify with a `kubectl get` if
using `kubectl` to create/update.

You can verify a failure occurred by running a `kubectl get` for the resource
you encountered the failure with. You can then see in the `DESCRIPTION` column
of the output of `kubectl get` if the reconciliation process for the resource
failed. An example of this is below:

```
NAMESPACE   NAME                  PACKAGE NAME          PACKAGE VERSION   DESCRIPTION                                                            AGE
foo         instl-pkg-test-fail   pkg.fail.carvel.dev   1.0.0             Reconcile failed: Error (see .status.usefulErrorMessage for details)   12s
```

### status.usefulErrorMessage
Once you have confirmed an error occurred, you can review the status of the CR
for more information.

Apps, PackageInstalls, and PackageRepsitories all feature a status property
named `usefulErrorMessage`. `usefulErrorMessage` which contains an error message
from kapp-controller or the stderr from the underlying tool used by
kapp-controller (i.e. vendir, imgpkg, kbld, ytt, kapp, or helm).

`usefulErrorMessage` will be located at the bottom of the statuses if running a
`kubectl get` or `kubectl describe` to view more information about a failure.

`usefulErrorMessage` can also be accessed more directly through `kubectl` like
in the following examples:

```
# App errors
$ kubectl get apps/simple-app -o=jsonpath={.status.usefulErrorMessage} -n namespace

# PackageInstall errors
$ kubectl get packageinstall simple-app -o=jsonpath={.status.usefulErrorMessage} -n namespace

# PackageRepository errors (cluster scoped so no namespace)
$ kubectl get packagerepository repo -o=jsonpath={.status.usefulErrorMessage}
```

### Errors from underlying tools (App CR and PackageInstall CR)

Failures can arise from fetch, template, deploy, or delete steps for an App CR.
These failures correspond to issues with runtime information declared in the App
CR's spec. kapp-controller creates an App CR for every PackageInstall 

Errors are reported as stderr from associated tools used in kapp-controller
(i.e. vendir, imgpkg, kbld, ytt, kapp, and helm) or as direct messages from
kapp-controller (e.g. when an App uses a ServiceAccount that doesn't exist). 

When a failure occurs with an App CR, you can find further details in the App
CR's `DESCRIPTION` column by running `kubectl get apps/simple-app -n namespace`:

```
NAME         DESCRIPTION                                                                                         SINCE-DEPLOY   AGE
simple-app   Delete failed: Preparing kapp: Getting service account: serviceaccounts "default-ns-sa" not found   3s             56m
```

In the case above, the error message shown is coming directly from
kapp-controller, so all the information for the failure should be presented in
the description column. This commonly occurs when references used by
kapp-controller (e.g. secrets, configmaps, serviceaccounts) are not found by
kapp-controller.

In cases where the error message does not originate from kapp-controller (e.g. a
failed fetch event for a git repository), the stderr from the underlying tool
(i.e. vendir, imgpkg, kbld, ytt, kapp, and helm) is shown in the App's status. 

In the App status, there is a field called `usefulErrorMessage` that displays
the stderr for a failure during App reconciliation.

This `usefulErrorMessage` field can be found by running `kubectl get
apps/simple-app -o=jsonpath={.status.usefulErrorMessage} -n namespace`.  The
kubectl command will return the stderr output from the App status to help you
further understand the reason for the App failure.

The `usefulErrorMessage` can be helpful in pointing out where errors occurred
from inputs in the App spec and also pinpoint the resource that caused a
deployment failure. However, Apps will not surface errors of resources they are
deploying to Kubernetes and further debugging of resources deployed by an App
may be needed.

### Debugging PackageInstall CRs

Failures for PackageInstalls can be viewed directly via the `usefulErrorMessage`
property of the PackageInstall's status. This `usefulErrorMessage` property
comes from an App CR that is created as a result of creating a PackageInstall.
More information on interpreting the error message from `usefulErrorMessage` can
be found under the [Errors from underlying tools](#Errors from underlying tools (App CR and PackageInstall CR)).  The underlying App
CR will have the same name as the PackageInstall that you create.

You can also inpect the Package CR referenced by the PackageInstall CR for issues. You can view the Package details by running the following command:

```
$ kubectl describe package/<package name>
```

You can then view the `.template.spec` of the Package to see if there are any
issues with the inputs of the Package. These inputs are eventually used to
create the App for the PackageInstall and can lead to failures.

### Debugging PackageRepository CRs

Failures for PackageRepositories can be viewed directly via the
`usefulErrorMessage` property of the PackageRepository's status. More information [here](status.usefulErrorMessage)

A common source of errors is being unable to fetch the PackageRepository
contents. Please check the `.spec.fetch` portion of the PackageRepository spec for issues related to this.

Is the registry you are fetching from require authentication? If so, check out [authenticating to private registries](private-registry-auth.md)

You can also fetch the PackageRepository `imgpkg` bundle or image separately and inspect format of Package resources.
