# Weekly Content Sharing
We're planning to showcase Carvel by publishing new content weekly. This will
increase the project's visibility so that we can grow the community.

We'd like this to be a lightweight effort (i.e. less formal than documentation).
The topic being covered can be anything Carvel-related, something that interests you that you wish to share with the community.
interesting to you. Some ideas include use case walkthroughs (one tool,
multi-tool, w/ non-Carvel tools), concept explanations, introducing new
features, or highlighting existing features. To broadcast awareness of our
publishings, we'll tweet and share them at community meetings.

Below is a signup for individuals to reserve weeks in advance.
