# Weekly Content Sharing
We're planning to showcase Carvel by publishing new content weekly. By sharing knowledge with the community, we expect to increase visibility and understanding of the project's tools, foster community growth, and provide global support for developers that traditional documentation might miss.

We'd like this to be a lightweight effort (i.e. less formal than documentation). The topic being covered can be anything Carvel-related, something that interests you that you wish to share with the community. Some ideas include use case walkthroughs (one tool, multi-tool, w/ non-Carvel tools), concept explanations, introducing new features, or highlighting existing features. To broadcast awareness of these publishings, we'll [tweet](https://twitter.com/carvel_dev), share them at [community meetings](https://hackmd.io/F7g3RT2hR3OcIh-Iznk2hw), and on the public Kubernetes Slack workspace in the [#carvel channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CH8KCCKA5).

Below is a signup for individuals to reserve weeks in advance. 

And, as a thank you for sharing your knowledge with the community, we would love to send a t-shirt to anyone who is a not a maintainer of Carvel that participates. Please send an email to [Nanci Lancaster](mailto:nancil@vmware.com) with your contact information so that we can get the right sized t-shirt shipped to you.
