# Weekly Content Sharing
We're planning to showcase Carvel by publishing new content weekly. Through sharing knowledge in various mediums with the community, this will increase visibility and understanding of the project's tools, foster community growth, and provide global support for developers that traditional documentation might miss.

We'd like this to be a lightweight effort (i.e. less formal than documentation).
The topic being covered can be anything Carvel-related, something that interests you that you wish to share with the community.
 Some ideas include use case walkthroughs (one tool,
multi-tool, w/ non-Carvel tools), concept explanations, introducing new
features, or highlighting existing features. To broadcast awareness of these publishings, we'll [tweet](https://twitter.com/carvel_dev) and share them at [community meetings](https://hackmd.io/F7g3RT2hR3OcIh-Iznk2hw) as well as on the public Kubernetes Slack workspace in the [#carvel channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CH8KCCKA5).
publishings, we'll tweet and share them at community meetings.

Below is a signup for individuals to reserve weeks in advance.
